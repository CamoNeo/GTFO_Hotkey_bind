Welcome to my Comms Hotkey resp

If u would like to edit what comm it uses go to "GTFOCommsHotkey.cs" and find the  
"Console.WriteLine("GTFO Comms activated - B"); SendKeySequence("q 1 1");" line and edit the via the "B" button (default) and the "SendKeySequence" "q 1 1" (Default)

.NET is required for this script to work

BE WARNED
WHEN THIS HAS BEEN ACTIVATED IT WILL NOT JUST WORK INSIDE OF GTFO **IT WILL WORK ON EVERY OTHER PLATFORM**
